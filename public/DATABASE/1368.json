    "The Ming Dynasty under the Choo Emperors defeat the Mongols and take the Mongolians as brides in Imperial harem, sends convoys to Malaya and Singapore to perform survey. Admiral Cheng Ho landed in area and recorded in annuals. Ming sent gifts of porcelain that was shipwrecked to Singapore that was recently discovered and excavated, and exhibited in Hong Kong's Kowloon Museum. The Ming Dynasty sent Hang Li Po as a bride to marry into the Sultanate class and to sinicize its friends in Malaya and did not colonize it. Thereafter, the Sultanate class and descendants have fairer complexion and Southern Chinese features. However, China did not interfere in its domestic affairs, only seek alliances to protect from any Japanese piracy or invasions which tragically happened in WW2 when the Qing were attacked and weakened by the Eight European Barbarian nations of USA, UK, Austro-Hungary, France, Russia, Italy, Spain, Portugal."

    "The second and most important wave of Slavic settlement takes place. Slavs and Avars settle in Eastern Alps (Julian Alps, Karavanke), eventually occupying an area more than twice the size of today&apos;s Slovenia. Slavic settlement is proven by the decline of dioceses in the Eastern Alpine region in second half of the sixth century, as well as in the change of population, the material culture and the linguistic identity of the area."
